By default, Entity Framework will use 'QuerySplittingBehavior.SingleQuery', which can potentially result in slow query performance.

2025-09-28 15:13:11.431 -05:00 [WRN] The query uses a row limiting operator ('Skip'/'Take') without an 'OrderBy' operator. This may lead to unpredictable results. If the 'Distinct' operator is used after 'OrderBy', then make sure to use the 'OrderBy' operator after 'Distinct' as the ordering would otherwise get erased.

The database-generated default will always be used for inserts when the property has the value '0', since this is the CLR default for the 'TemplateStatus' type. Consider using a nullable type, using a nullable backing field, or setting the sentinel value for the property to ensure the database default is used when, and only when, appropriate.
