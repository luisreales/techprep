2025-09-29 06:23:51.419 -05:00 [WRN] The foreign key property 'InterviewCertificate.SessionId1' was created in shadow state because a conflicting property with the simple name 'SessionId' exists in the entity type, but is either not mapped, is already used for another relationship, or is incompatible with the associated primary key type. See https://aka.ms/efcore-relationships for information on mapping relationships in EF Core.
2025-09-29 06:23:51.464 -05:00 [WRN] The foreign key property 'PracticeSessionTopic.TopicId1' was created in shadow state because a conflicting property with the simple name 'TopicId' exists in the entity type, but is either not mapped, is already used for another relationship, or is incompatible with the associated primary key type.

2025-09-29 06:23:51.487 -05:00 [WRN] The 'TemplateStatus' property 'Status' on entity type 'SessionTemplate' is configured with a database-generated default, but has no configured sentinel value. The database-generated default will always be used for inserts when the property has the value '0', since this is the CLR default for the 'TemplateStatus' type. Consider using a nullable type, using a nullable backing field, or setting the sentinel value for the property to ensure the database default is used when, and only when, appropriate. See https://aka.ms/efcore-docs-default-values for more information.
2025-09-29 06:26:26.422 -05:00 [WRN] Compiling a query which loads related collections for more than one collection navigation, either via 'Include' or through projection, but no 'QuerySplittingBehavior' has been configured. By default, Entity Framework will use 'QuerySplittingBehavior.SingleQuery', which can potentially result in slow query performance. See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2134277 for more information. To identify the query that's triggering this warning call 'ConfigureWarnings(w => w.Throw(RelationalEventId.MultipleCollectionIncludeWarning))'.

2025-09-29 11:11:52.667 -05:00 [WRN] The query uses a row limiting operator ('Skip'/'Take') without an 'OrderBy' operator. This may lead to unpredictable results. If the 'Distinct' operator is used after 'OrderBy', then make sure to use the 'OrderBy' operator after 'Distinct' as the ordering would otherwise get erased.
