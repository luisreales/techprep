JavaScript,intermediate,multi_choice,Which of the following are JavaScript primitive types?,"A) string;B) object;C) number;D) boolean;E) function",A;C;D,
JavaScript,basic,written,What is a closure in JavaScript?,,,"A closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has returned. It gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function."
React,basic,single_choice,What is JSX in React?,"A) A database query language;B) A syntax extension for JavaScript;C) A CSS framework;D) A testing library",B,
React,intermediate,single_choice,Which hook is used for side effects in React?,"A) useState;B) useEffect;C) useContext;D) useReducer",B,
React,advanced,written,Explain the concept of Virtual DOM in React,,,"The Virtual DOM is a JavaScript representation of the actual DOM. React creates an in-memory virtual representation of the real DOM elements. When state changes occur, React creates a new virtual DOM tree and compares it with the previous one using a diffing algorithm, then updates only the parts of the real DOM that have changed."
Python,basic,single_choice,Which of the following is the correct way to define a function in Python?,"A) function myFunc() {};B) def myFunc():;C) func myFunc() {};D) define myFunc() {}",B,
Python,intermediate,multi_choice,Which of the following are mutable data types in Python?,"A) list;B) tuple;C) dict;D) set;E) string",A;C;D,
Python,basic,written,What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?,,,"Lists are mutable (can be changed after creation) and use square brackets [], while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation) and use parentheses (). Lists are used when you need to modify the collection, tuples when you need a fixed collection of items."
SQL,basic,single_choice,Which SQL command is used to retrieve data from a database?,"A) GET;B) FETCH;C) SELECT;D) RETRIEVE",C,
SQL,intermediate,single_choice,What does the JOIN clause do in SQL?,"A) Combines rows from two or more tables;B) Adds new columns to a table;C) Deletes duplicate rows;D) Sorts the result set",A,
SQL,advanced,written,Explain the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN,,,"INNER JOIN returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables. LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If there's no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table."
Algorithms,basic,single_choice,What is the time complexity of binary search?,"A) O(n);B) O(log n);C) O(n log n);D) O(nÂ²)",B,
Algorithms,intermediate,multi_choice,Which sorting algorithms have O(n log n) average time complexity?,"A) Bubble Sort;B) Merge Sort;C) Quick Sort;D) Insertion Sort;E) Heap Sort",B;C;E,
Algorithms,advanced,written,Explain how the quicksort algorithm works,,,"Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array so that elements smaller than the pivot come before it and elements greater come after it. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays on either side of the pivot until the entire array is sorted."
System Design,intermediate,single_choice,What is the primary benefit of using a load balancer?,"A) Increases storage capacity;B) Distributes incoming requests across multiple servers;C) Encrypts data transmission;D) Reduces database size",B,
System Design,advanced,written,What is database sharding and when would you use it?,,,"Database sharding is a method of horizontally partitioning data across multiple database instances. Each shard contains a subset of the data. It's used when a single database cannot handle the load or storage requirements, helping to improve performance and scalability by distributing the workload across multiple servers."
C#,basic,single_choice,Which keyword is used to define a class in C#?,"A) class;B) struct;C) interface;D) object",A,
C#,intermediate,single_choice,What is the difference between 'ref' and 'out' parameters in C#?,"A) No difference;B) ref requires initialization, out doesn't;C) out requires initialization, ref doesn't;D) They work with different data types",B,
C#,advanced,written,Explain the concept of dependency injection in C#,,,"Dependency injection is a design pattern where objects receive their dependencies from external sources rather than creating them internally. In C#, it's commonly implemented through constructor injection, where dependencies are provided through the constructor parameters. This promotes loose coupling, testability, and maintainability by allowing easy substitution of dependencies."
